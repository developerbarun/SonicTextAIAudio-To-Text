#Audio-to-Text Conversion with Librosa, Noisereduce, and Vosk

This Python project aims to convert audio files into text using a combination of the Librosa, Noisereduce, and Vosk models. It provides a convenient way to transcribe spoken words or speech from audio recordings into written text.

Features:
- Accepts various audio file formats, including WAV, MP3, and more.
- Applies noise reduction techniques using the Noisereduce library to enhance audio quality before transcription.
- Utilizes the Librosa library for audio processing and feature extraction, such as extracting spectrograms or mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).
- Integrates the Vosk model, which is a state-of-the-art speech recognition model based on neural networks, to perform the actual transcription.
- Outputs the transcribed text as a result, allowing further analysis or manipulation of the converted text data.

Usage:
1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Prepare your audio file in a supported format.
3. Execute the main script, providing the path to your audio file as input.
4. The program will process the audio, perform noise reduction, transcribe the speech, and display the converted text on the console.

Contributing:
Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues if you encounter any problems or have suggestions for improvements.

Note:
Please be aware that the accuracy of the transcription heavily depends on the quality and clarity of the audio input. No model is perfect, so some errors or inaccuracies in the transcriptions may occur.
